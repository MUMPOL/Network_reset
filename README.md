### 2. **Link to Your Repo from Social Media, Forums, Blogs, etc.**
- Google finds pages faster when **other indexed pages link to them**.
- You can post it on:
  - Reddit (e.g., r/sysadmin or r/PowerShell)
  - X (Twitter)
  - Facebook
  - Your personal blog

### 3. **Submit It to Google Manually (Optional)**
You can ask Google to index it directly:
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
2. Use the **"URL Inspection"** tool.
3. Paste your GitHub repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/MUMPOL/Network_reset`)
4. Click **“Request Indexing”**

---

### 4. **Be Patient — It Will Show Up**
Even without extra effort, your repo **will be indexed eventually** if it's public and has content.

Would you like help writing a better `README.md` with keywords to help it get indexed faster? I can generate one for you!
